servo-style
===========

Prototype replacement style system for Servo,
based on [rust-cssparser](https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-cssparser)
instead of [NetSurf’s libcss](https://github.com/mozilla-servo/libcss).

This is meant to go into Servo’s `src/components/script/style` directory,
but is maintained here for now because I’m using a patched Rust.
(See [pull request](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8396).)
